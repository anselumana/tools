USAGE

    python finder.py <option> root string/filename/dirname [extension]

DESCRIPTION

    Program built for finding files and/or directories matching a given criteria within a tree starting with root.
    The criteria can be a string (in which case all files and directories containg it will be considered matches)
    or the full filename/dirname.
    If called without options it will find and print all files and directories containing the given string in
    their basename (extension excluded).

OPTIONS

    -e [--exact]
        Print all files and directories who's name matches exactly the given filename/dirname.
    
    -h [--help]
        Show this manual page.

    -x [--extension]
        Print all files containing the given string in their basename and that have the given extension.

CAVEATS

    The last argument ([extension]) will be evaluated only if the -x option is used, in which case is mandatory.


The program has been developed by Ansel Umana.
